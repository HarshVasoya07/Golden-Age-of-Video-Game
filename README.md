<h1>Project: When Was the Golden Age of Video Games?</h1>


<h2>Project Description</h2>
In this project, we delved into the world of video games to evaluate whether there is a discernible "golden age" based on critical and user reviews. Through an analysis of best-selling games, critic scores, user scores, and sales figures, we gained insights into the evolution of the gaming industry. While there isn't a definitive golden age, certain years emerged as exceptional. The years 1998, 2002, and 2008 stood out as they were not only highly acclaimed by both critics and players but also achieved significant commercial success with impressive sales figures. This project highlights the dynamic nature of the video game industry and its ability to captivate audiences across different eras.
